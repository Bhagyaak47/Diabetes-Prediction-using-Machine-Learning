# Diabetes-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
This repository contains the code and documentation for predicting diabetes using machine learning techniques. The aim is to build a model that can accurately predict whether a person has diabetes based on various health parameters.

# Project Overview
Diabetes is a chronic condition that affects millions of people worldwide. Early detection and management are crucial for preventing severe health complications. This project leverages machine learning algorithms to create a predictive model using the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset.

# Dataset
The dataset used is the Pima Indians Diabetes Database,the data contains( Rows 768,Columns 9) which includes the following features:

1. Pregnancies: Number of times the patient has been pregnant
2. Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
3. BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
4. SkinThickness: Triceps skinfold thickness (mm)
5. Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
6. BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
7. DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Diabetes pedigree function (a function which scores likelihood of diabetes based on family history)
8. Age: Age (years)
9. Outcome: Class variable (0 or 1), indicating whether the patient tested positive for diabetes (1) or not (0)

# Usage

1. Explore the data and perform preprocessing using the provided google colab
2. Train the machine learning model by running the script
3. Use the trained model to make predictions. Here is an example of how to predict if a person is diabetic based on input data

# Results
The project uses an SVM classifier to predict diabetes with an accuracy of approximately 77%.
